# Web_Scrapping_python


 I’m going to create a web scraper with Python that pulls all the stories from Google News by extracting all the tags from the HTML of Google News
 
 
 Google News uses tags to create links to the various websites that make up the site.
 
 
 So in addition to some additional data, you’ll collect all the URLs of the articles that Google News displays.
 
 
 
 I will use the BeautifulSoup module to analyze the articles from Google News.
 

Parsing means taking a format like HTML and using a programming language to give it structure.


For example, transforming data into an object. Now, to start this task of creating a web scraper with Python, you need to install a module named BeautifulSoup.


It can be easily installed using the pip command; pip install beautifulsoup4.
